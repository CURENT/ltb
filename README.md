# CURENT Large-scale Testbed

The Large-scale Testbed (LTB) is a tightly integrated, closed-loop platform for rapid prototyping of power systems. **[ANDES](https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/index.html)**, **[AMS](https://github.com/jinningwang/ams)** (under development), **[DiME](https://ltbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**, and **[AGVis](https://agvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#what-is-agvis)** are four major independent sub packages of LTB that serve as a dynamic simulator, market simulator, distributed messaging environment, and grid visualizer, respectively. Towards a one-stop solution, these LTB packages can serve for both individual and federated use.

# Why LTB

LTB platform enables power system *dynamic simualiton*, *market simulation*, *geographical visualization*, *real-time simualtion*, and ***dispatch-dynamic co-simulaiton***.

*Getting trouble with dispatch in a dynamic simulation?* The interoperability of ANDES for scheduling supports secured dispatch in a dynamic simulation.

*Getting lost in the APIs of simulators?* Easy-to-use ANDES and AMS can be your last stop to prototype new algorithms and models.

*Looking for a geographical visualization?* AGVis allows geographical visualization with multiple options.

*Interested in a real-time closed-loop simulation?* LTB has integrated simulators and communication environments.
