# CURENT Large-scale Testbed

<img src="docs/source/images/sponsors/CURENT_Logo_NameOnTrans.png" alt="CURENT ERC Logo" width="300" height="auto">

A closed-loop platform for rapid power systems prototyping. It includes
four independent sub-packages: **[ANDES](https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/index.html)** for dynamic simulation, **[AMS](https://github.com/jinningwang/ams)** for market simulation (under development), **[DiME](https://ltbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** for distributed messaging, and **[AGVis](https://agvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#what-is-agvis)** for geo-visualization. Towards a one-stop solution, these packages can be used individually or together.

# Why LTB

The LTB platform offers several features for power systems testing and prototyping, including dynamic simulation, market simulation, geographical visualization, real-time simulation, and ***dispatch-dynamic co-simulation***.

Having trouble with dispatch in a dynamic simulation? ANDES provides interoperability for scheduling, which supports secure dispatch in dynamic simulations.

Finding it difficult to navigate through multiple software APIs? The LTB platform offers user-friendly tools like ANDES that can help you prototype new algorithms and models.

Looking for geographical visualization? AGVis allows for flexible customization of geographical visualization.

Are you interested in real-time closed-loop simulation? LTB integrates simulators and communication environments, providing you with a powerful platform to prototype and test power system controls and algorithms.
