Tutorial
=====================

LTB can be used as a command-line tool or a library.
The command-line interface (CLI) comes handy to run studies.
As a library, it can be used interactively in the IPython shell
or the Jupyter Notebook.
This chapter describes the most common usages.

Command line
============

LTB is invoked from the command line using the command ``ltb`` ::

      usage: ltb [-h] [-v {1,10,20,30,40}] {run,misc,doc,plot,selftest,st,demo} ...

      positional arguments:
      {run,misc,doc,plot,selftest,st,demo}
                              [demo] run gallery;

      optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v {1,10,20,30,40}, --verbose {1,10,20,30,40}
                              Verbosity level in 10-DEBUG, 20-INFO, 30-WARNING, or 40-ERROR.

Jupyter Notebook
========================

You can use LTB in the Jupyter Notebook to create interactive simulations
and visualizations, as well as to analyze and plot data generated by LTB
simulations. Check out the LTB gallery (comming soon) for examples and tutorials
on how to use LTB in the Jupyter Notebook.
