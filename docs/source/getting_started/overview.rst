Platform Overview
=====================

The CURENT Large-scale Testbed (LTB) is a state-of-the-art research facility designed for rapid prototyping
of power systems. It is a tightly integrated, closed-loop system consisting of four major independent sub-packages:
ANDES for dynamic simulation, AMS (under development) for market simulation,DiME for distributed messaging
environment, and AGVis for grid visualization. These LTB packages can be used individually or in a federated manner,
making it a versatile tool for power system research and development.

LTB is developed and actively maintained by the `LTB Team <https://ltb.curent.org/about/>`_.
