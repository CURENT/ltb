Our Story So Far [Update 2023-04]
===============================================

In 2014-2015, the director of CURENT, Dr. Kevin Tomsovic, proposed the idea of creating
a closed-loop testbed for power systems research. He appointed Dr. Fran Li to lead the
development work of what is now known as the CURENT Large-scale Testbed (LTB) or CLTB.

During the first two years of development, the team built models of the North American
power grid, including WECC and reduced EI operation and planning models, with various
renewable energy penetration scenarios. They also created a nationwide HVDC overlay
and integrated initial versions of a visualizer and data transfer package called DiME
into the CLTB platform.

In 2017, the team decided to develop their own dynamic simulation engine called ANDES,
which was created by Dr. Hantao Cui and has become a cornerstone package in CLTB. ANDES
can now be used as a standalone dynamic simulation tool as well.

Around the same time, newer versions of DiME and the visualizer (now called AGVis) were
developed with contributions from Nick West, Nicholas Parsly, and Jinning Wang.
